This is a project to create a Makefile that'll bootstrap a newly-provisioned
Ubuntu 12.x VM in the Joyent Public Cloud (at http://my.joyentcloud.com ) into
a working IPSec+L2TP VPN gateway, suitable for connecting your Mac OSX 
computer, or iPhone/iPad to.
(this probably works with windows and other vpn clients, too, though)

How to use this:

- provision new ubuntu 12.04 image in JPC and log into it
- apt-get update
- apt-get install git make
- git clone https://ryancnelson@bitbucket.org/ryancnelson/jpc-l2tp-ipsec.git
- cd jpc-l2tp-ipsec
- make
   (here, it tells you "you need to run 'make updateto384' to update your kernel")
- do that:  make updateto384
- reboot, then login again in 30 seconds
- cd jpc-l2tp-ipsec
- make
- answer the questions about creating an X.509 certificate with "No"
  (just hit return, then again for "ok")

- set up your Mac to connect an IPsec+L2TP VPN to the IP Address given, 
  with shared secret "letmein", and default username/password "archer/dutchess"

see http://ryan.net/misc/skitch/ipsec_L2TP_vpn_mac-20130324-233228.jpg 
for a screenshot of where to set this up on your Mac
(on the Mac, click "Advanced" and check "Send all traffic over VPN connection"
unless you want to add your own routes, manually.)
